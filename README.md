# Algo Note Books üìö

## Overview üåü

Algo Note Books is an open-source archive of Jupyter notebooks, created by Ant Greene (me), showcasing a variety of algorithms and techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. Each notebook is a standalone example, demonstrating key concepts with practical code and explanations.

## Notebooks üìì

### 1. FFTex.ipynb
- **Description**: Demonstrates the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of a signal composed of multiple sine waves. It includes signal generation and FFT application.
- **Key Concepts**: Fast Fourier Transform, Signal Analysis, Sine Waves.

### 2. LSTM.ipynb
- **Description**: Builds a Sentiment Analysis model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in TensorFlow. The model classifies text data into positive or negative sentiment.
- **Key Concepts**: LSTM Networks, Sentiment Analysis, TensorFlow.

### 3. NLPviz.ipynb
- **Description**: Demonstrates a basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for text classification using TensorFlow, covering dataset preparation, model building, training, and evaluation.
- **Key Concepts**: Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, TensorFlow.

### 4. kclusterEX.ipynb
- **Description**: Implementation and visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Includes generation of synthetic data with distinct clusters.
- **Key Concepts**: K-Means Clustering, Unsupervised Learning, Data Visualization.

### 5. GP_learning_1.ipynb
- **Description**: Explores Genetic Programming (GP) techniques for evolving algorithms and solutions to complex problems. Demonstrates GP methodology and application.
- **Key Concepts**: Genetic Programming, Evolutionary Algorithms, Problem Solving.

### 6. negative-Floattree.ipynb
- **Description**: Visualizes fractals based on negative floats, detailing their properties (scale, angle, depth) derived from the float's structure. Each number creates a distinct fractal and an analytical breakdown.
- **Key Concepts**: Fractals, Floating-Point Numbers, Data Visualization, Pattern Analysis.

### 7. QJulia.ipynb
- **Description**: Interactive exploration of Julia sets with quantum computing principles. This notebook provides a UI for visualizing Julia fractals, allowing parameter adjustments for real and imaginary components, plot range, and iteration depth.
- **Key Concepts**: Julia Sets, Fractal Generation, Quantum Computing, Complex Dynamics, Interactive Visualization.
